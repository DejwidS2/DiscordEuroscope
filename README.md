# DiscordEuroscope ALPHA
A plugin written to provide discord rich presence feature for our lovely EuroScope.
And the good news is that it supports both ES *3.1d* and *3.2*!

All you need is to *load the plugin*, and it'll work!
You can download the plugin from the Releases page. Or compile it yourself using Visual Studio 2015 or newer (better avoid that or you'd lose your mind, like me :D ).
