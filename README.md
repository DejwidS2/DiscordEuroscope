# DiscordEuroscope ALPHA
A plugin written to provide discord rich presence feature for our lovely EuroScope.
And the good news is that it supports both ES *3.1d* and *3.2*!

All you need is to *load the plugin*, and it'll work!
You can download the plugin from the Releases page. Or compile it yourself using Visual Studio 2017 (better avoid that or you'd lose your mind, like me :D ).

**Please** report any bugs in the issues section of this repository.
**All of the credits go to the original creator u/Kirollos.
This is just an edit to be used inside Polish Virtual Area Control Center
